# Class Notes Week 10

## Tree in Java
- like a root
- top element represents base of tree
- tips of tree are called leaves

### Automatic Maintaining of Tree
- based on compareTo method
- smaller things go on the left, larger on the right

### When to use
- NOT when there are a lot of insertion and deletions; hashmap would be better
- very application specific

### Creating of Tree

- Tree root is changed for optimization 
- logN

**Weighted Graph** for finding the shortest route

## Recurcion
- used to as a good way to reuse code
- not always appicable
- similar to tree sorting
- breaking down until there is just two elements
- **On final exam**
- essential parts:
    - **Base Case:** problem can be solved with one step
    - **Recursive Case:** gets problem to point where it can be solved with one step
- can be used to sort arrays

### Steps to use recursion
- know when to stop/when the problem is solved
- how to break it apart
- how to bring it together

### Recurcion Example

- hogs memory
- things get stuck at the bottom of the stack

## Next Exam
- Java Collections Framework
